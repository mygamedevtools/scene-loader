# Contribution Guide

Thank you for considering contributing to Advanced Scene Manager! Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a feature, or improving the documentation, your contributions are greatly appreciated and help make the tool better for everyone.

## How to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute to Advanced Scene Manager:

### 1. Reporting Issues

If you encounter any bugs or have feedback on features, please report them by opening an issue. When reporting an issue, please provide as much detail as possible, including:

- Steps to reproduce the bug (if applicable)
- What behavior you expected and what actually happened
- Any relevant error messages or logs

### 2. Submitting Code Changes

If you'd like to submit code to fix an issue or add a feature, please follow these steps:

#### Fork the Repository

- Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
- Click the Fork button in the upper-right corner to create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

#### Clone Your Fork

Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/advanced-scene-manager.git
```

#### Create a New Branch

Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-name-or-bugfix
```

#### Make Your Changes

Make your changes to the code or documentation. When working on code:

- Follow the existing coding style and conventions.
- Make sure to write unit tests for new features or bug fixes if applicable.

For documentation changes, the documentation resides in the `docs` branch of the repository. You can switch to this branch if you're only updating the docs or contributing to new documentation.

#### Create a Pull Request

Open a pull request from your fork to the main repository. In the PR description, provide a clear explanation of what you've done, the issue it addresses, and any relevant details.

- For code changes, the PR should be made against the main branch.
- For documentation changes, the PR should be made against the `docs` branch.

This allows us to keep the documentation and code contributions in their respective branches.
Documentation changes can be submitted in the same way as code changes, by creating a PR from your fork.

### 3. Improving Documentation

We welcome any improvements to the documentation as well. If you spot a typo or think something could be explained better, feel free to submit a pull request with the suggested changes!

### 4. Feature Requests

If you have an idea for a new feature, open an issue and describe the feature in detail. Be sure to explain why you think it would be valuable for other users. If you plan to implement the feature yourself, let us know in the issue before you start so we can discuss the approach.
